# Project 1 - Linear Regression
###### Using the [Combined Cycle Power Plant Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Combined+Cycle+Power+Plant) from the UCI Database.

The first project of the *Frequentist Machine Learning* course consisted of three parts, each using the same training, validation, and testing sets:

**a)** Build a linear regression model by hand.

**b)** Build a linear regression model with ridge regularization by hand. Select the optimal value of lambda by cross-validation using the validation dataset.

**c)** Use the built in sci-kit learn package to do a Lasso Regression. Select the optimal value of lambda by cross-validation using the validation dataset. Display a Lasso plot.

Compute the MSE on the training dataset and the test dataset for all methods.
