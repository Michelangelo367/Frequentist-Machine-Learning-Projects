# Project 2 - Logistic Regression
###### Using the [Banknote Authentication Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication) from the UCI Database.

The second project of *Frequentist Machine Learning* consisted of two parts, each using the same training, validation, and testing sets:

**a)** Implement Stochastic Gradient Ascent by hand.

**b)** Implement Stochastic Gradient Ascent with regularization by hand. Calculate the best lambda parameter using the validation set.

Plot the likelihood function with respect to iterations for both parts on one set of axes.
